//Question

// Each house has a certain amount of money stashed,
//  the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them
//  is that adjacent houses have security system connected and
//   it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
//Given a list of non-negative integers representing the
//amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of
// money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
//
//Example
